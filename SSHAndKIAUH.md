#SSH

For SSH, I recommend a wonderful little free program called PuTTy

https://www.putty.org/

Download the version you need for your computer and install it. It's all good, I will wait! :)
Done? Awesome!! Lets fire PuTTy up!!
Create a new connection and pop the IP address for your Raspberry Pi in.
It will do its connection thing and ask your for your username and password, which if you followed the previous page should be 'pi' and 'raspberry'.
The first command we are going to enter is to check for updates on the Raspberry Pi OS
```
sudo apt update
```
The second command is to actually grab the updates
```
sudo apt upgrade
```
